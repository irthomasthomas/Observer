              Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Observer AI application
              and related services (the "Service") operated by Observer AI LLC ("Observer AI," "we," "us," or "our").
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
              By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with
              any part of the Terms, you may not access the Service.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>
              Observer AI provides a platform for creating and running micro-agents that can observe your
              digital environment (screen, microphone, camera, clipboard), process information using AI models,
              and take actions such as sending notifications. The Service includes desktop applications, mobile
              applications, and web-based interfaces.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">3. Open Source License</h2>
            <p>
              Observer AI is open source software. You have an implied license to compile, modify, and run your
              own version of Observer from the <a href="https://github.com/Roy3838/Observer" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">source code</a>.
              When using a self-compiled version with local inference providers and Discord notifications (which
              connect directly to Discord's servers), no data passes through our servers and these Terms do not
              apply to such usage.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">4. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>
              To use certain features of the Service, you must create an account. You are responsible for:

            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">5. User Content and License Grant</h2>
            <p>
              You retain ownership of any agents, prompts, code, and other content you create ("User Content").

              royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, distribute, and display
              such content in connection with the Service.

              User Content does not infringe any third-party rights.

            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">8. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
              The Service and its original content (excluding User Content), features, and functionality are
              owned by Observer AI and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.
